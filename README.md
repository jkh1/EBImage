## Installation

This package is a fork of the [original](https://github.com/aoles/EBImage) that makes some variables from the image viewer available to Shiny apps.

To install this version of the package, start R and enter:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("jkh1/EBImage")
```
Note that this may overwrite a preexisting EBImage installation.

## Documentation

For an overview of the package functionality, see the [package vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/EBImage/inst/doc/EBImage-introduction.html).

Once you install the package, you can access individual man pages by a call to, e.g., `?Image`.
